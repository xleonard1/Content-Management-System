# Content-Management-System


## Description

As a Full Stack developer, I was tasked with creating an interface that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. I did this by building a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

This project required the user to be able to
```

Accept user input
Be presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
Choose to view all departments
Present formatted table showing department names and department ids
Choose to view all roles
Present the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
Choose to view all employees
Present a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
Choose to add a department
Enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
Choose to add a role
Enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
Choose to add an employee
Enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
Choose to update an employee role
Select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database 
```
